## Simple Packet Sniffer

A lightweight packet sniffer built using Python and Scapy. This script captures network packets, extracts basic details (such as source/destination IP and protocol type), and logs them for further analysis.

### Features
- Captures IP packets (TCP, UDP, and DNS traffic).
- Displays captured packets in real-time.
- Logs packet details to `captured_packets.log`.
- Uses Scapy for flexible packet processing.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed and Scapy installed on your system. You can install Scapy using:

```bash
pip install scapy
```

### Usage
Run the script with administrative privileges to start sniffing packets:

```bash
sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py  # Linux/Mac
python packet_sniffer.py        # Windows (Run as Administrator)
```

To stop the sniffer, use `CTRL+C`.

### Output Example
The script will print and log captured packet details like:

```
[+] Packet: 192.168.1.10 -> 8.8.8.8 | Protocol: DNS
[+] Packet: 10.0.0.5 -> 192.168.1.20 | Protocol: TCP
```
